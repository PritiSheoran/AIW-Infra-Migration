# HOL3: Exercise 4: Failover the Infrastructure to Azure Cloud


### Estimated time: 35 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy the Failover from on-premises to Azure. After setting up replication to Azure for on-premises machines, when your on-premises site goes down, you fail those machines over to Azure. After a failover, Azure VMs are created from replicated data.

## Lab objectives

In this exercise, you will complete the following task:

- Task 1: Failover the Infrastructure to Azure Cloud

### Task 1: Failover the Infrastructure to Azure Cloud

1. In the **search resources, services and docs bar**, type **Recovery services vaults (1)**. From the dropdown results under **Services**, click on **Recovery Services vaults (2)**.

1. On the **Recovery service vaults** page, click on **SmartHotelMigration<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />-MigrateVault-xxxx**.  

    ![](Images/15-7-25-2.png "create Recovery service vaults")
    
1. On the **Recovery Service Vault page**, click on **Replicated Items (1)** under **Protected Items** section and select **AzureArcVM (2)**.

1. On the **Test failover cleanup** page, enter `Test failover ok.` under **Notes (1)** and make sure to **(2) check the box: Testing is complete. Delete test failover virtual machine(s)** and then click on **OK (3)**.

   > **Note:** Wait for the cleanup test failover to get completed successfully.

1. Go back to the Replicated items page and select **Site Recovery Jobs (1)** under **Monitoring (2)** from the left-hand side panel and click on **Failover (3)** to view the job status.

   ![Screenshot of the failover jobs.](Images/5-7-25-h4-5.png "failover jobs") 
   
1. On the **Failover** page, wait for **10-15 minutes** for the failover job to complete. The **Status** column should show **Successful** for all key steps.

1. After the Failover is completed successfully, go to **Protected items (1)** → **Replicated items (2)** and verify that the status of the replicated **AzureArcVM (3)** shows **Failover completed** with **Active location** as **Microsoft Azure**.

   > **Note:** If you want to switch to a different recovery point to use for the failover, use **Change recovery point**.   
  
   ![Screenshot of the recovery points.](Images/5-7-25-h4-8.png "recovery points") 
   
1. On the **replicated AzureArcVM** page, click on **Commit** to commit the failover (The Commit action deletes all the recovery points available with the service).

1. On the **Commit** page, click on **Ok**.   

   ![Screenshot of the commit page.](Images/5-7-25-h4-10.png "commit page") 
   
1. After the Failover is **committed successfully**,  In the **Search resources, services, and docs** bar, type **Virtual Machines** **(1)** and select **Virtual machines** from the Services **(2)**.

### Summary

In this exercise, you explored how to fail over on-premises physical servers that are replicating to Azure with Azure Site Recovery. After you've failed over, you fail back from Azure to your on-premises site when it's available.
